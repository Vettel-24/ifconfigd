     oossppffdd..ccoonnff - Open Shortest Path First daemon configuration file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ospfd(8) daemon implements the Open Shortest Path First protocol
     version 2 as described in RFC 2328.

SSEECCTTIIOONNSS
     The oossppffdd..ccoonnff config file is divided into three main sections.

     MMaaccrrooss
           User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying
           the configuration file.

     GGlloobbaall CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn
           Global settings for ospfd(8).  A number of global settings can be
           overruled in specific areas or interfaces.

     AArreeaass
           An OSPF router must be a member of at least one area.  Areas are
           used to group interfaces, simplifying configuration.

     Additional configuration files can be included with the iinncclluuddee keyword,
     for example:

           include "/etc/ospfd.sub.conf"

MMAACCRROOSS
     Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.  Macro
     names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits, and
     underscores.  Macro names may not be reserved words (for example, aarreeaa,
     iinntteerrffaaccee, or hheelllloo--iinntteerrvvaall).  Macros are not expanded inside quotes.

     For example:

           hi="5"
           area 0.0.0.0 {
                   interface em0 {
                           hello-interval $hi
                   }
           }

     The same can be accomplished by specifying the hello-interval globally or
     within the area declaration.

GGLLOOBBAALL CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
     All interface related settings can be configured globally, per area and
     per interface.  The only settings that can be set globally and not
     overruled are listed below.

     ffiibb--uuppddaattee (yyeess|nnoo)
             If set to nnoo, do not update the Forwarding Information Base,
             a.k.a. the kernel routing table.  The default is yyeess.  Setting
             ffiibb--uuppddaattee to nnoo will implicitly set the ssttuubb rroouutteerr option to
             ensure that no traffic tries to transit via this router.

     rrddoommaaiinn _t_a_b_l_e_i_d
             Specifies the routing table ospfd(8) should modify.  Table 0 is
             the default table.

     [nnoo] rreeddiissttrriibbuuttee (ssttaattiicc|ccoonnnneecctteedd|ddeeffaauulltt) [sseett ......]
     [nnoo] rreeddiissttrriibbuuttee _p_r_e_f_i_x [sseett ......]
     [nnoo] rreeddiissttrriibbuuttee rrttllaabbeell _l_a_b_e_l [sseett ......]
             If set to ccoonnnneecctteedd, routes to directly attached networks will be
             announced over OSPF.  If set to ssttaattiicc, static routes will be
             announced over OSPF.  If set to ddeeffaauulltt, a default route pointing
             to this router will be announced over OSPF.  It is possible to
             specify a network range with _p_r_e_f_i_x; networks need to be part of
             that range to be redistributed.  Additionally it is possible to
             redistribute based on route labels using the rrttllaabbeell keyword.  By
             default no additional routes will be announced over OSPF.

             rreeddiissttrriibbuuttee statements are evaluated in sequential order, from
             first to last.  The first matching rule decides if a route should
             be redistributed or not.  Matching rules starting with nnoo will
             force the route to be not announced.  The only exception is
             ddeeffaauulltt, which will be set no matter what, and additionally nnoo
             cannot be used together with it.

             It is possible to set the route mmeettrriicc and ttyyppee for each
             redistribute rule.  ttyyppee is either 1 or 2.  The default value for
             ttyyppee is 1 and for mmeettrriicc is 100.  Setting more than one option
             needs curly brackets:

                   redistribute static set { metric 300 type 2 }

     rrffcc11558833ccoommppaatt (yyeess|nnoo)
             If set to yyeess, decisions regarding AS-external routes are
             evaluated according to RFC 1583.  The default is nnoo.

     rroouutteerr--iidd _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
             Set the router ID; if not specified, the numerically lowest IP
             address of the router will be used.

     rrttllaabbeell _l_a_b_e_l eexxtteerrnnaall--ttaagg _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Map route labels to external route tags and vice versa.  The
             external route tag is a non-negative 32-bit number attached to
             AS-external OSPF LSAs.

     ssppff--ddeellaayy (_s_e_c_o_n_d_s|mmsseecc _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s)
             Set the SPF delay.  The delay between receiving an update to the
             link state database and starting the shortest path first
             calculation.  The default value is 1 second; valid range is 10
             milliseconds-10 seconds.

     ssppff--hhoollddttiimmee (_s_e_c_o_n_d_s|mmsseecc _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s)
             Set the SPF holdtime.  The minimum time between two consecutive
             shortest path first calculations.  The default value is 5
             seconds; the valid range is 10 milliseconds-5 seconds.

     ssttuubb rroouutteerr (yyeess|nnoo)
             If set to yyeess, all interfaces with active neighbors will have a
             metric of infinity.  This ensures that the other routers prefer
             routes around this router while still being able to reach
             directly connected IP prefixes.  The ssttuubb rroouutteerr option is
             automatically enabled if either the sysctl(8) variable
             _n_e_t_._i_n_e_t_._i_p_._f_o_r_w_a_r_d_i_n_g is set to a value different to 1 or if the
             FIB is not coupled.

AARREEAASS
     Areas are used for grouping interfaces.  All interface-specific
     parameters can be configured per area, overruling the global settings.

     aarreeaa _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
             Specify an area section, grouping one or more interfaces.

                   area 0.0.0.0 {
                           interface em0
                           interface em1 {
                                   metric 10
                           }
                   }

     Area specific parameters are listed below.

     ddeemmoottee _g_r_o_u_p [_c_o_u_n_t]
             Increase the carp(4) demotion counter by _c_o_u_n_t on the given
             interface group, usually _c_a_r_p, when no neighbor in the area is in
             an active state.  The demotion counter will be decreased when one
             neighbor in that area is in an active state.  The default value
             for _c_o_u_n_t is 1.

             For more information on interface groups, see the ggrroouupp keyword
             in ifconfig(8).

     ssttuubb [rreeddiissttrriibbuuttee ddeeffaauulltt] [sseett ......]
             Mark the area as _s_t_u_b.  Stub areas will not be flooded by as-ext
             LSA, resulting in smaller routing tables.  Area border routers
             should redistribute a default network LSA; this can be enabled by
             specifying the default redistribute option.  A default summary
             LSA will only be redistributed if the router has an active
             connection to the backbone area 0.0.0.0.

IINNTTEERRFFAACCEESS
     Each interface can have several parameters configured individually,
     otherwise they are inherited.  An interface is specified by its name.  If
     multiple networks are configured an additional IP address can be
     supplied.  By default the first IP address is used.

           interface em0 {
                   auth-type crypt
                   auth-md 1 "yotVoo_Heypp"
                   auth-md-keyid 1
           }
           interface fxp0:192.168.1.3

     Interface-specific parameters are listed below.

     aauutthh--kkeeyy _k_e_y
             Set the authentication key for ssiimmppllee authentication.  Up to 8
             characters can be specified.

     aauutthh--mmdd _k_e_y_-_i_d _k_e_y
             Set the authentication _k_e_y_-_i_d and _k_e_y for ccrryypptt authentication.
             The valid range for _k_e_y_-_i_d is 0-255.  Up to 16 characters can be
             specified for _k_e_y.  Multiple keys may be specified.

     aauutthh--mmdd--kkeeyyiidd _k_e_y_-_i_d
             Configure the _k_e_y_-_i_d to use for ccrryypptt authentication.  The valid
             range for _k_e_y_-_i_d is 0-255.  The default key-id is 1.  While key-
             id 0 is valid, it is unavailable on various other
             implementations.

     aauutthh--ttyyppee (nnoonnee|ssiimmppllee|ccrryypptt)
             Set the authentication type.  The default is nnoonnee.  Simple
             authentication uses a plaintext password, up to 8 characters.
             Crypt authentication uses an MD5 hash.

     ddeemmoottee _g_r_o_u_p
             Increase the carp(4) demotion counter by 1 on the given interface
             group, usually _c_a_r_p, when the interface state is going down.  The
             demotion counter will be decreased when the interface state is
             active again.

     ffaasstt--hheelllloo--iinntteerrvvaall mmsseecc _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             If the interface is configured to use rroouutteerr--ddeeaadd--ttiimmee mmiinniimmaall,
             hello packets will be sent using this timer.  The default value
             is 333; valid range is 50-333 milliseconds.

     hheelllloo--iinntteerrvvaall _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             Set the hello interval.  The default value is 10; valid range is
             1-65535 seconds.

     mmeettrriicc _c_o_s_t
             Set the interface metric a.k.a. cost.  The default value is 10;
             valid range is 1-65535.

     ppaassssiivvee
             Prevent transmission and reception of OSPF packets on this
             interface.  The specified interface will be announced as a stub
             network.

     rreettrraannssmmiitt--iinntteerrvvaall _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             Set retransmit interval.  The default value is 5 seconds; valid
             range is 5-3600 seconds.

     rroouutteerr--ddeeaadd--ttiimmee (_s_e_c_o_n_d_s|mmiinniimmaall)
             Set the router dead time, a.k.a. neighbor inactivity timer.  The
             default value is 40 seconds; valid range is 2-2147483647 seconds.
             If the router dead time has been set to mmiinniimmaall, the timer is set
             to 1 second and hello packets are sent using the interval
             specified by ffaasstt--hheelllloo--iinntteerrvvaall.  When a neighbor has been
             inactive for router-dead-time its state is set to DOWN.
             Neighbors that have been inactive for more than 24 hours are
             completely removed.

     rroouutteerr--pprriioorriittyy _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y
             Set the router priority.  The default value is 1; valid range is
             0-255.  If set to 0 the router is not eligible as a Designated
             Router or Backup Designated Router.

     ttrraannssmmiitt--ddeellaayy _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             Set the transmit delay.  The default value is 1; valid range is
             1-3600 seconds.
