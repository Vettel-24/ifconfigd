     rreellaayydd is a daemon to relay and dynamically redirect incoming connections
     to a target host.  Its main purposes are to run as a load-balancer,
     application layer gateway, or transparent proxy.  The daemon is able to
     monitor groups of hosts for availability, which is determined by checking
     for a specific service common to a host group.  When availability is
     confirmed, layer 3 and/or layer 7 forwarding services are set up by
     rreellaayydd.

     Layer 3 redirection happens at the packet level; to configure it, rreellaayydd
     communicates with pf(4).  To allow rreellaayydd to properly set up pf(4) rules,
     the following line is required in the filter section of pf.conf(5):

           anchor "relayd/*"

     Layer 7 relaying happens at the application level and is handled by
     rreellaayydd itself.  Various application level filtering and protocol-specific
     load-balancing options are available for relays.

     rreellaayydd works in terms of the following _e_n_t_i_t_i_e_s: relays, protocols,
     redirections, and tables.  A _r_e_l_a_y represents a layer 7 load-balancing
     instance.  Each instance translates to a listening TCP or UDP port.  A
     _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l defines which actions, if any, are taken on the packet payload
     as data crosses a relay.  A _r_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n represents a layer 3 load-
     balancing instance.  Each instance translates to a pf(4) rdr-to rule
     being added.  A _t_a_b_l_e represents a group of hosts which can be checked
     for availability using the same method.  Each table contains at least one
     host.  If a table is used in a layer 3 load-balancing instance, it will
     be mapped to a pf(4) table containing only those hosts which are up.

     All these entities can be configured in relayd.conf(5), and relayctl(8)
     can be used to alter or report on the status of each entity.

     The options are as follows:

     --DD _m_a_c_r_o=_v_a_l_u_e
             Define _m_a_c_r_o to be set to _v_a_l_u_e on the command line.  Overrides
             the definition of _m_a_c_r_o in the configuration file.

     --dd      Do not daemonize.  If this option is specified, rreellaayydd will run
             in the foreground and log to _s_t_d_e_r_r.

     --ff _f_i_l_e
             Specify an alternative configuration file.  The default is
             _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_l_a_y_d_._c_o_n_f.

     --nn      Configtest mode.  Only check the configuration file for validity.

     --vv      Produce more verbose output.

     The rreellaayydd program, formerly known as hhoossttssttaatteedd, first appeared in
     OpenBSD 4.1.  It was renamed to rreellaayydd in OpenBSD 4.3.

     The rreellaayydd program was written by Pierre-Yves Ritschard <pyr@openbsd.org>
     and Reyk Floeter <reyk@openbsd.org>.
